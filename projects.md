Here are some projects I have worked on in the past. Please contact me if you are interested in any of these ideas (particularly those under "Personal Interest"), would like to see the source code, or would like to take any of them further.

## Industry/Experience
Network Security Consolidation Portal (Iconectiv)
- Full Stack project to help promote security amongst different teams at Iconectiv
- Seeks to produce one cohesive security report for clients & application leads
- Aggregates all security risk data scanned from various sources and collects it all into a single portal
- Used primarily Node.js and RESTful APIs

## Personal Interest

Neural Network Based Image Dataset Generator
- Tool that utilizes YOLO to generate image datasets from video data
- Ex: A user can submit a request for a turtle image dataset, feed the model as many video files as desired, and get as output a large collection of turtle images taken from various frames in the video
- Sorts resultant images at 90%+ accuracy
- Provides the potential for massive dataset generation, as videos inherently contain immense amount of photos of essentially everything

Neural Network Based Keychain Art Generator
- Tool for mass producing and cropping cartoon/anime characters for printing onto acrylic keychain
- Ex: I can tailor the trianing data to search for a specific character, feed the model a set of episodes of the show, and get as output a wide range of image cutouts of the character that would be essentially ready to be uv printed onto keychains
- Also doubles as a good "profile picture" generator for a desired cartoon/anime character
- Born from my desire to mass produce acrylic keychains, but laziness in procuring the art/images for them

AI Soccer VAR
- An ongoing effort to combine a wide range of neural networks to serve all the traditional purposes of the soccer referee
- Events include (but are hopefully not limited to): offsides, fouls, yellow/red cards, how much extra time, whether the ball went out of bounds, etc.
- Currently struggles at foul detection, primarily due to the lack of training data

## School

Neural Network Minesweeper Player
- CNN focused minesweeper bot

Neural Network Email Processor
- Customized traditional email filtering techniques for a more personalized spam filter

Android Chess App
- Developed an application for basic chess
- Included supplementary features: recording games, playing against the AI, etc.

Auction Website Emulator
- Full stack project that simulates public auction sites
- Explores possibilities for increasing bidder activity (ex: how to encourage earlier bidding instead of the last minute bidding trends we currently have?)
- Implemented usage data trackers, automated to produce data visualizations
