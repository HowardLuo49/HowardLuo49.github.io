Here are some projects I have worked on in the past. Please contact me if you are interested in any of these ideas, would like to see the source code, or would like to take any of them further (particularly those under "Personal Interest").

## Industry/Experience
Network Security Consolidation Portal (Iconectiv)
- Full Stack project to help promote security amongst different teams at Iconectiv
- Seeks to produce one cohesive security report for clients & application leads
- Aggregates all security risk data scanned from various sources and collects it all into a single portal
- Used primarily Node.js and RESTful APIs

## Research
Currently not included here due to possible confidentiality concerns. Please look at the 'Research' tab and contact me if interested.

## Personal Interest

Neural Network Based Image Dataset Generator
- Tool that utilizes YOLO to generate image datasets from video data
- Ex: A user can submit a request for a turtle image dataset, feed the model as many video files as desired, and get as output a large collection of turtle images taken from various frames in the video
- Sorts resultant images at 90%+ accuracy
- Provides the potential for massive dataset generation, as videos inherently contain immense amount of photos of essentially everything

Neural Network Based Keychain Art Generator
- Tool for mass producing and cropping cartoon/anime characters for printing onto acrylic keychain
- Ex: I can tailor the trianing data to search for a specific character, feed the model a set of episodes of the show, and get as output a wide range of image cutouts of the character that would be essentially ready to be uv printed onto keychains
- Also doubles as a good "profile picture" generator for a desired cartoon/anime character
- Born from my desire to mass produce acrylic keychains, but laziness in procuring the art/images for them

Speaker Diarization Subtitle Generator
- Ongoing experiment to generate color coded video subtitles for multiple speakers
- Seeking to handle situations where multiple individuals are speaking simultaneously

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">
Youtube Automatic Timestamp Generator
- Tool for giving viewers recommended timestamps within a youtube video to skip to
- Helps users find when the information they are looking for in a video is presented
- Serves as a method to divide videos into "chapters"

AI Soccer VAR
- An ongoing effort to combine a wide range of neural networks to serve all the traditional purposes of the soccer referee
- Events include (but are hopefully not limited to): offsides, fouls, yellow/red cards, how much extra time, whether the ball went out of bounds, etc.
- Currently struggles at foul detection, primarily due to the lack of training data

Genshin Impact Resource Calculator (Inactive)
- HTML website for calculating resource requirements for any set of desired upgrades
- Included dynamic back-end components for resource management functionality

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">

Navigation Automation Website (Inactive)
- Custom built HTML website for completing repetitive mundane tasks
- Automated frequent actions for personal use (Ex: Opening up my email and preparing a generic template for sending out to a specified list of individuals)

## School

Neural Network Minesweeper Player
- CNN focused minesweeper bot
- Added functionality to adjust to various board sizes and mine densities

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">

Neural Network Email Processor
- Customized traditional email filtering techniques for a more personalized spam filter
- Implemented adaptive machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust to a user's preferences
- Since different individuals have different preferences on what they consider "spam", this gives the ability to adjust to each person's liking

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">

Android Chess App
- Developed an application for basic chess
- Included supplementary features: recording games, playing against the AI, etc.
- Used Android Studio to provide interactable UI
- Tested with thousands of historical chess games to ensure robustness
- Experimented with multiple phone simulations to ensure device flexibility

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">

Auction Website Emulator
- Full stack project that simulates public auction sites
- Explores possibilities for increasing bidder activity (ex: how to encourage earlier bidding instead of the last minute bidding trends we currently have?)
- Implemented usage data trackers, automated to produce data visualizations

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">

Photo Album
- Full stack project that serves as place to store images
- Used JavaFX for UI functionality
- Implemented features for tagging, filtering/searching, and timestamping photos

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">

Custom Text Justification
- Designed a program to automatically format text files
- Upgraded to handle entire directories recursively
- Incorporated multi-threading for larger tasks (~35% reduction in time complexity for each additional thread, with diminishing returns)

<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background-color: #808080;">

Enhanced Malloc
- Improved upon malloc from the standard C library to customize handling of memory requests
- Implemented "intermediary caching" to make it easier for users to understand their memory usage
- Improved space freeing/allocation speed by roughly 25% for most traditional uses
