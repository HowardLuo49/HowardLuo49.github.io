Hey there!
<br>
I am a junior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, pursuing a triple major in computer science, mathematics, and statistics with a minor in data science.
<br>
However, I am still primarily a computer science major at heart.
<br>
I enjoy problem solving and applying my unique skillset in creative ways for novel purposes. I like to bring a high degree of ingenuity to anything and everything I work on. I enjoy exploring the more uncommon approaches in varying environments.
