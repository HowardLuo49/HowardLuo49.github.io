Hey there!
<br>
<br>
I am a junior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, pursuing a triple major in computer science, mathematics, and statistics with a minor in data science.
<br>
However, I am still primarily a computer science major at heart.
<br>
<br>
I enjoy innovative problem solving and applying my unique skillset in creative ways for novel purposes.
I like to push the bounds of ingenuity with anything and everything I work on.
Although not always successful, I love exploring unconventional ideas in pursuit of innovation.
