The following are some projects I've worked on before. My background is more tailored to the machine learning subset, but my interests span a wide range of AI topics. I have a particular interest in applying neural networks in novel contexts for "quality of life" purposes.


## Alphazero Based Neural Networks for 2 Move Chess
- Advisors/Collaborators: Professor Stoyan Dimitrov
## Large Language Models for Scientific Problem Solving Based on Retrieval Augmented Hint Generation
- Advisors/Collaborators: Professor Yongfeng Zhang, Professor Alexandre Morozov, PhD Student Haoming Gong
## Integration of Large Language Models in Classroom Environments 
- Advisors/Collaborators: Professor Tomasz Imielinski
